Apart from my regular university courses – which are not covered on this page yet – I enjoy teaching workshops and other extra-curricular courses at different summer schools, conferences, and so forth. These include, at the first place, the following annual (or biannual) events:

* [Digital Humanities Summer Institute](https://www.dhsi.org/) (DHSI) in Victoria BC, Canada.
* [The European Summer University “Culture & Technology”](https://esu-ct.conference.ubbcluj.ro/) (ESU) formerly in Leipzig, Germany, and these days in Cluj-Napoca, Romania.
* [GIAT-IQLA Summer School in Quantitative Analysis of Textual Data](https://www.fisppa.unipd.it/giat-en/home) in Padova, Italy.

In the upcoming 3 years the ESU event will travel to Cluj-Napoca (Romania), and later to somewhere else; whereas the school Victoria seems to be back to its pre-pandemic shape, but my course underwent some reshaping. Therefore, the above list of events might differ a bit in the near future; nonetheless there will definitely be some opportunities around!




## Materials on Youtube
